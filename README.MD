Repository created to practice and get insights on how to use RAG architecutre, vector databases, and LLMs.

# RAG Architecture with Vector Databases and LLMs

This repository contains code and examples demonstrating how to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture using vector databases and Large Language Models (LLMs). The focus is on integrating these components to enhance the capabilities of AI applications.

# Features

- **Vector Database Integration**: Use of vector databases to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently.
- **LLM Integration**: Connecting to various LLMs for generating responses based on retrieved data.
- **RAG Implementation**: Combining retrieval and generation to create a robust AI system.
- **Examples and Use Cases**: Practical examples showcasing how to use RAG in real-world scenarios.
